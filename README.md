## Project Background 📝

This project was born out of a personal need and a quick idea that came to mind while applying for a job. Many job applications require various links like GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolios, live projects, etc. Remembering all these links can be challenging, especially when some URLs include random numbers or aren't personalized.

While custom URLs with names are easier to recall, most of mine were not, and I often struggled to remember them on the spot. I realized I needed a better way to save and access the links I use most frequently during job applications and daily browsing.

Browsers can keep tabs open, but this only works if you have a high-performance system. In my case, keeping many tabs open slows down my machine, so I usually close them after use. This led me to create a simple yet effective link listing tool to store and organize all my important URLs in one place.

I couldn’t find any existing solution online that met my exact needs, so I decided to build my own. The goal was to create both a webpage and a browser extension where I could save, search, and manage (edit/delete) my frequently used links using simple keywords.

And that's how Credlys was born — a tool designed to make accessing essential URLs effortless.
